# TASKENATOR

Taskenator is a program that allows you to create tasks, add descriptions and images, and then mark them as complete. It is a simple program that I made to practice my Python skills.

## USE

main.py is the pure code, without the (badly implemented) GUI. test_notebook.py is the code that have the GUI implemented
